First make sure you're inside the programs directory:
  cd path/to/program/
(replace the dir names with the actual names of the directories)

Then let autogen.sh to run as a program
  chmod +x autogen.sh

Next run the autogen.sh:
  ./autogen.sh

If the configuration ended successfully you can run the makefile:
   make

That is all. Enjoy !
